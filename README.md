# Overview

I am creating a introductory data analysis program for teachers that will grade and organize assignments and student information.

The software, Gradebook, handles important analysis of top scores on assignments, how many students in a class, and provides a dataframe to record points, while easily altering or curving test scores to resemble the needs of a teacher in regards to a class.

These set of gradebooks, organized and managed in R. Are meant to act as an organizational tool for teachers, and a comfort to students to be able to see how they perform in relation to the rest of the class. This would help them see where they may be falling behind. It also helps teachers know where they need to improve in their teaching.

# Development Environment

* IDE - RStudio: Version 2022.12.0+353 (2022.12.0+353) - Integrates the best with R because it was made for it. It runs code line by line into the console.
* Language - R: version 4.2.2 (2022-10-31) - Used for data analysis and representing datasets.

Within R Language, I used two libraries:
- tidyverse: Makes it easy to install other packages. And transitions R to use more natural language. 
- dplyr: It adds a common set of commands that simplify accessing, modifying, and removing elements in an R data structure.

# Future Work

- Create a function that streamlines the process of inputting grades
- Add a row that indicates how many points each assignment is worth
- Improve the visual graphing to output in the same place as the CSV
